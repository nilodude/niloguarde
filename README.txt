INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN:

	1. Unzip "/niloguarde" directory INSIDE your ableton project. 
		"/niloguarde" directory means the directory itself, NOT THE FILES.
		"/niloguarde" directory and your .als (ableton live set) file should be AT THE SAME LEVEL 
	
	2. Inside /niloguarde, run "niloguarde.exe".
	
	3. Have fun exploring your ableton project as an enormous XML file. 
	   This XML file can be watched/tracked by any Version Control software,
	   providing huge and valuable information about what specific changes you made to the project.
